Project 2 report:

Team members:
- Kelly Wang
- Jonathan Day
- Ajit Vijayakumar

PART 1:

In our opinion, we found this part was the most difficult
and thus the most educational, so we worked on them together at csil
over the period of several afternoons, so we did these functions together:

Fork(func)
Yield()
Exit(int)
Exec(filename)
Join()

PART 2:

For part 2, we found that these sections were more easy to do invididually,
and because we have busy schedules, we implemented them separately. We did
use eachother for help and advice when necessary so all the functions worked together 
under a similar methodology.

The breakdown for these are:

Creat()- Kelly
Open() - Kelly
Read() - Jonathan
Write() - Jonathan
Close() - Ajit

As a team, we believe that we all contributed equally to this project,
and our happy with how we work as a team.
